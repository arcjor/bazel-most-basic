# STEP7

Now make the custom build tool process and output the input.

Now we can bazel build and we get:
```
vscode âžœ /workspaces/bazel-most-basic (feat/bazel-simple-beginnings) $ bazel build //...
INFO: Analyzed 3 targets (1 packages loaded, 6 targets configured).
INFO: From Action my_python_output.txt:

```

And we get our expected output in the file.
