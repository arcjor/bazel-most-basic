# STEP6

Now add a custom build tool with a python binary.

This step is the simplest form, it doesn't do anything other than 'hello world' yet.

We can do a bazel *run* now:

```
vscode âžœ /workspaces/bazel-most-basic (feat/bazel-simple-beginnings) $ bazel run //:my_build_tool -- infile outfile
INFO: Analyzed target //:my_build_tool (0 packages loaded, 0 targets configured).

```
